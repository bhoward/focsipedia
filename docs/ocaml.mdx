# OCaml

[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is a functional programming language developed at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) over the past thirty years.
It belongs to the [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) family of statically-typed
functional languages, which includes [Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/),
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/), and Microsoft's [F#](https://fsharp.org/). ML was originally
developed as the **M**eta **L**anguage for the LCF theorem prover at the University of
Edinburgh, and has long been a valuable tool for programmers working with formal logic or
developing other programming languages. It was a major influence in the design of the
functional languages [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), and more recently it has seen adoption in financial
services (for example, [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com/) and
[Jane Street](https://janestreet.com)) and web development (particularly at
[Facebook](https://facebook.com)).

One advantage of OCaml is that its compiler is remarkably fast and sophisticated, and it can
generate JavaScript output for running programs in a web browser. In fact, since the
compiler itself is written in OCaml, it is possible to compile the entire system to
JavaScript and run it in the browser.

Here is an editor where you can type in OCaml code and execute it (click the button
or type Ctrl-Enter):

```ocaml edit
let x = 6
let y = x * 7
let rec fact x = if x <= 1 then 1 else x * (fact (x - 1))
let _ = fact 5
```

If for some reason you want to reset the interpreter before executing the code (so that
it will forget previous bindings), press the Shift key plus Ctrl-Enter.
