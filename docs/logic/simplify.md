## Circuit Simplification

As noted above, a physical circuit does have some dependence on time, since each
device in the circuit requires a non-zero time to respond to a change in its
inputs. A more precise model needs to take these delays into account&mdash;a circuit
is modeled by a Boolean expression _plus_ a set of delay factors (other
cost measures may also be important: power consumption, heat production, area
occupied, _etc_., but we will focus on the delay issue here). We will
make the simplifying assumption that all gates have the same delay time, so we
will measure the total delay of a circuit in terms of the number of gate delays
required before the output values accurately reflect a change to the input
values.

Given a combinational circuit, we may compute the delay, also known as the
**span**, by finding the number of gates on the longest path (the **critical
path**) from an input to an output. For example, the circuit in
the figure below has a span of three gate delays, with the critical path
passing either through the AND, NOT, AND sequence along the top, or through the
NOT, OR, AND along the bottom. Note that this is a conservative estimate of the
delay required, although for certain inputs the output may become stable
sooner&mdash;for example, if the $B$ input changes from 0 to 1 while $A$ is 0,
then after one gate delay the output of the OR will become 1; since the output
of the upper NOT was already 1 in this case (why?), the final output will settle
at 1 after only two gate delays. However, other combinations of inputs may well
take the entire three gate delays to correctly determine the value of the
output.

One approach to reducing the delay of a circuit is to use the [disjunctive normal
form](circuits#disjunctive-normal-form), also known as the **sum-of-products**. Since
an expression in DNF is the OR of a collection of terms which are the AND of
some number of simple terms, and a simple term is either an input or a negated
input, the corresponding circuit can be constructed in three layers:

alt="Three-layer circuit for disjunctive normal form" className="centered-figure" />

An interesting property of the sum-of-products representation falls out of the
De Morgan laws. Since $(a\land b)\lor(c\land d)=\lnot(\lnot(a\land
b)\land\lnot(c\land d))=(a\uparrow b)\uparrow(c\uparrow d)$, the two layers of
AND and OR gates may be replaced entirely with NAND gates to get an
equivalent circuit!

alt="Three-layer circuit for disjunctive normal form using only NAND gates" className="centered-figure" />

Unfortunately, this does not mean that any Boolean expression can be computed by
a circuit with only three gate delays. One problem comes when we need AND and OR
gates (or NAND gates) with more than two inputs&mdash;in general, with $n$ input
variables, there may be AND gates that need $n$ inputs, and there could be on
the order of $2^n$ gates in the AND level, requiring an OR gate with that many
input lines. We will see in the next section how to build gates with a larger
number of inputs out of gates with just two inputs, at the cost of an increased
gate delay.

### Karnaugh Map

Another problem with DNF comes if we use the full DNF expression extracted from
a truth table. If we use the DNF Theorem to produce an expression from the truth
table for the implication $p\rightarrow q$, we will get $(\lnot p\land\lnot
q)\lor(\lnot p\land q)\lor(p\land q)$. However, we may use Boolean algebra identities to
find an equivalent DNF expression, $\lnot p\lor q$ (which only needs two gate
delays, since the AND layer disappears). There are general techniques for
finding simpler DNF expressions such as this; we will look at a straightforward
technique called a **Karnaugh map**, although for computer implementation
the related Quine-McCluskey algorithm is better (and for large numbers of input
variables a heuristic approach is necessary).

A Karnaugh map is a way of visualizing entries in a truth table so that adjacent
entries only differ on the value of one input variable. For example, the entry
for $\lnot p\land q$ will be next to the entry for $p\land q$. If adjacent
entries each contain 1, meaning that those terms would participate in the full
DNF expression, then they may be replaced by a single term with just the
variables that are the same: in the example, this corresponds to the
simplification $(\lnot p\land q)\lor(p\land q)=(\lnot p\lor p)\land q=\T\land
q=q$.

For two input variables, a Karnaugh map is a $2\times 2$ array:

$$
\begin{array}{r|cc}
& \lnot{q} & q\\ \hline
\lnot{p} & x_{00} & x_{01}\\
p & x_{10} & x_{11}
\end{array}
$$

This is just a compact rearrangement of the truth table:

$$ \begin{array}{cc|c}
p & q & x\\ \hline
0 & 0 & x_{00}\\
0 & 1 & x_{01}\\
1 & 0 & x_{10}\\
1 & 1 & x_{11}
\end{array} $$

However, note that the adjacent cell condition is true: horizontally adjacent
cells only differ on $q$, while vertically adjacent cells only differ on $p$.

Once we have laid out the Karnaugh map, a simplified expression may be read off
by finding a way to cover all of the 1's in the map with "implicants." An
implicant is a rectangle whose side lengths are a power of 2; it corresponds to
finding a collection of adjacent cells in the map (all of which contain 1) that
all agree on some of the input literals and that collectively include all
combinations (negated or not) of the other input variables. The resulting term
for an implicant is just the product of the common literals among all the cells
covered by the implicant.

On a $2\times 2$ map, the only implicants are individual cells ($1\times 1$), a
row ($1\times 2$), a column ($2\times 1$), or the entire map ($2\times 2$). The
cells correspond to terms such as $p\land\lnot{q}$, the rows are either
$\lnot{p}$ or $p$, the columns are either $\lnot{q}$ or $q$, and the entire map
is $1$ (the empty product). To get the simplest expression, we want to take the
fewest number of the largest possible implicants that between them cover all of
the 1's in the map. Implicants may overlap, as long as all of (and only) the 1's
are covered by at least one implicant.

Here is the example again. First the truth table for $p\rightarrow q$:

$$ \begin{array}{cc|c}
p & q & x\\ \hline
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array} $$

As a Karnaugh map, this is:

$$ \begin{array}{r|cc}
& \lnot{q} & q\\ \hline
\lnot{p} & 1 & 1\\
p & 0 & 1
\end{array} $$

The best way to cover this map with implicants is to take the first row and the second column. That gives the simplified terms $\lnot{p}$ and $q$, so the final simplified expression is $\lnot{p}\lor q$. Here is the map with the implicants outlined:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/KarnaughImp.png')}
alt="Karnaugh map for implication" className="centered-figure" />

A Karnaugh map can also work with three or four input variables, producing
either a $2\times 4$ or a $4\times 4$ array. The same procedure applies, with
three complications:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To satisfy the adjacent cell condition, successive rows or columns must
change only one variable at a time: for example, the rows might be labelled in
order $\lnot{p}\land\lnot{q}$, $\lnot{p}\land q$, $p\land q$, and $p\lnot{q}$;
\item Implicants may be 1, 2, or 4 rows tall by 1, 2, or 4 columns wide; and
\item Implicants may "wrap around" from one side of the map to the other.
\end{enumerate}
For example, on a $4\times 4$ map, one possible implicant is the middle two
rows; another is the leftmost and rightmost columns (wrapping horizontally); a
third is the $2\times 2$ block consisting of the middle two elements of the top
row and the middle two elements of the bottom row (wrapping vertically); a final
example is the last two elements of the third row:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/KarnaughImplicants.png')}
alt="Examples of Karnaugh Map implicants" className="centered-figure" />

### Don't Care Values

A Karnaugh map also allows us to find simple circuits in the case that some
combinations of inputs will never occur, so that we do not care what the output
is in those rows of the truth table. By entering a **don't care** value, such
as X, in the map, we have the freedom to either ignore or include those cells
when covering the map with implicants; by including a cell with an X along with
a group of 1's, we might be able to construct a larger (and hence simpler)
implicant.

For example, suppose we have the following truth table for a four-variable
Boolean expression (this represents the inputs that are binary numbers less than
ten and divisible by three):

$$ \begin{array}{cccc|c}
p & q & r & s & x\\ \hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & X\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & X\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & X\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & X\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & X\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & X
\end{array} $$

As a Karnaugh map, this is:

$$ \begin{array}{r|cccc}
& \lnot{r}\land\lnot{s} & \lnot{r}\land s & r\land s & r\land\lnot{s}\\ \hline
\lnot{p}\land\lnot{q} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
\lnot{p}\land q & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
p\land q & X & X & X & X\\
p\land\lnot{q} & 0 & 1 & X & X
\end{array} $$

The 1's, plus some of the X's, may be covered by four implicants:
$\lnot{p}\land\lnot{q}\land\lnot{r}\land\lnot{s}$, $\lnot{q}\land r\land s$,
$q\land r\land\lnot{s}$, and $p\land s$. Note that the second implicant wraps
around from the third cell on the top row to the third cell (with an X, which is
also covered by the $p\land s$ implicant) on the bottom row; if it were just the
1 on the top row, then the term would be $\lnot{p}\land\lnot{q}\land r\land s$,
which is not as simple. Here are the cells that end up being covered:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/KarnaughExampleMap.png')}
alt="Example Karnaugh Map with implicants outlined" className="centered-figure" />

Therefore, the simplified expression is
$(\lnot{p}\land\lnot{q}\land\lnot{r}\land\lnot{s})\lor(\lnot{q}\land r\land
s)\lor(q\land r\land\lnot{s})\lor(p\land s)$. This may be computed by the
following circuit:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/KarnaughExampleCircuit.png')}
alt="Resulting circuit for a Karnaugh Map example" className="centered-figure" />

In the next section, we will see how to implement this with a total delay of 5, using only two-input AND and OR gates.

### Exponential Blowup

The final difficulty with building low-delay circuits from DNF expressions is
that, even with the simplification provided by something like a Karnaugh map,
many Boolean functions lead to an exponential blowup when expressed in DNF. In
the worst case, an expression with $n$ input variables may require $O(2^n)$
terms in a sum-of-product representation&mdash;consider the case of a Karnaugh
map where the 1's are in a checkerboard arrangement, so that none are adjacent.
When $n$ is large enough, it might not even be practical to consider the truth
table at all; for example, a circuit that can add two 32-bit numbers requires 64
input lines, which would lead to a truth table with $2^{64}\approx 10^{19}$
entries. The next section will also discuss approaches to this kind of problem.

## Exercises

1. For each of the following Boolean expressions, compute the total delay of the
   direct translation of the expression into a circuit.
   * $\lnot{(\lnot{p}\lor q)}\lor(\lnot{\lnot{q}}\lor\lnot{p})$
   * $(\lnot(\lnot{r}\land p)\lor\lnot{q})\land(\lnot(\lnot{r}\land q)\lor\lnot{p})$
   * $(((p\lor q)\land(q\lor r))\land(r\lor s))\land(((p\lor r)\land(q\lor s))\land(p\lor s))$

2. For each of the expressions in the previous problem, use a Karnaugh map to
   find an equivalent sum-of-products expression, and draw the resulting
   circuit.

3. Suppose we want to build a counter that cycles through the numbers 0, 1, 2,
   3, 4, and back to 0. One element of this counter will be a circuit that takes
   the current number, expressed in binary, and outputs the next number. Here is
   the truth table for this function, with three inputs ($a$, $b$, and $c$) and
   three outputs ($x$, $y$, and $z$):

$$ \begin{array}{ccc|ccc}
a & b & c & x & y & z\\ \hline
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & X & X & X\\
1 & 1 & 0 & X & X & X\\
1 & 1 & 1 & X & X & X\\
\end{array} $$

   Since the counter should never reach numbers 5, 6, or 7, we do not care about
   the output when $abc$ is 101, 110, or 111. Use Karnaugh maps to find a simple
   circuit for this function.

4. In **binary-coded decimal** (BCD), four bits are used to represent the
   numbers 0 (0000) through 9 (1001); the other six bit patterns (1010 through
   1111) are unused. BCD is often used in circuits where decimal numbers need to
   be displayed; a common device for doing so is the **seven-segment display**.
   Using only seven elements (for example, light-emitting diodes), we may form a
   reasonable approximation of all the digits 0--9:
   
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/SevenSegmentDigits.png')}
alt="Digits 0 through 9 as shown in a seven-segment display" className="centered-figure" />

   Construct a truth table with four inputs and seven outputs showing how to
   produce these characters from input in BCD (be sure to include a diagram
   indicating which output column corresponds to which display element). Use
   Karnaugh maps to design a relatively simple circuit that implements a
   seven-segment decoder.

5. An exercise in the [Circuits](circuits#exercises) section examines
   conjunctive normal form (CNF), the dual of DNF. Explore what kind of circuits
   result from CNF, and how to extract a simplified CNF expression from a
   Karnaugh map _(Hint: look at blocks of 0's.)_.
