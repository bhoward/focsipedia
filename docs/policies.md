## Texts (to be updated)

* Carol Critchlow, David Eck, and Brian Howard, "Foundations of Computation," in preparation (available on Moodle)

* Dave Gurnell and Noel Welsh, "Creative Scala," Underscore, 2017 (available on Moodle and from https://www.creativescala.org/)

* (supplemental) Alfred V. Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman, "Foundations of Computer Science," W. H. Freeman, 1992 (available from http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html)

## Course Description

(from the Catalog) This course explores the theoretical foundations of computation at various levels of abstraction. Specific topics include graph theory and related algorithms; functional programming with an emphasis on recursion and recurrences; the description of languages using formalisms such as regular expressions, finite state machines, and context free grammars; and digital logic and its application to sequential and combinational circuits.

## Grading

The grade for this course will be based on the following:

* 20%: Quizzes -- most classes will start with a short quiz, often taken from the exercises for the day; to avoid penalizing those who might miss a day or two, the bottom three quiz grades will be dropped.
* 25%: Graded Homework -- there will be some kind of assignment given almost every day: readings, exercises, small programming projects; most of these will not be collected, and will mostly serve to prepare you for the quiz and the class discussion. However, every week or two there will be a larger assignment that will be collected and graded -- these will be clearly marked in the [schedule](blog).
* 30%: In-term exams -- TBA and TBA; each will cover the preceding five weeks, and will be open-book/note.
* 25%: Final exam -- (Section A) Saturday, May 9, 8:30-11:30 am, (Section B) Monday, May 11, 8:30-11:30 am; this will be comprehensive and open-book/note.

The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A (95-100), A- (90-94), B+ (88-89), B (84-87), B- (80-83), C+ (78-79), C (74-77), C- (70-73), D+ (68-69), D (64-67), D- (60-63), F (0-59). I reserve the right to alter this grading scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class with a W is Friday, March 20.

## Policy Statements

* You are expected to attend all class sessions. However, I expect you to take your own education seriously, so I do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up with the material that was covered and any announcements that were made.
* There will be no makeup quizzes.
* Homework assignments are due by the start of class on the assigned date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions will be considered only by prior arrangement.
* Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others, etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity and may result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade to course failure or expulsion. The policy and discussion of each student's obligations and rights are in the Student Handbook.
* With respect to this course, no collaboration is permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework problems with anyone you want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you should not copy another student's work nor permit your work to be copied. The key idea is that you should understand all of the work you turn in, and you should be able to replicate it on your own. If you do not feel that you can replicate the work independently, then it is not fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes "appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility to clarify it with me.
* During class time, the computer at your seat should be used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read e-mail, browse the web, play games, etc. while class is in session.
* Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week after the assignment or exam is returned to the student. To request a regrade, please write out on a separate sheet of paper your request and attach it to the assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request for more points without a justification is not sufficient! Keep in mind that the entire assignment or exam may be regraded, so carefully consider your requests!
* Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and negative) about my performance or anything else related to the class. This feedback will have no effect on your grade in the class.
* Reading assignments will be given in class. They will mostly consist of readings from the class textbook, but other handouts and papers may be assigned as well.
* All information about the class, whether given in this handout or in class, is subject to change.

## Commitment to Student Success and ADA Accommodations

I am committed to helping each and every one of my students succeed and am willing to work as hard to facilitate that success. Please don't hesitate to contact me outside of class (see office hours section of this syllabus) if you think I can help. There are also a number of other offices on campus that can help you succeed with your courses as well as help you connect your course work to service, co-curricular and leadership experiences. These offices include Student Life, the Hubbard Center for Student Engagement, the Wellness Center, the Office of Academic Life, and Student Disability Services. In particular, note that it is the policy and practice of DePauw University to provide reasonable accommodations for students with properly documented disabilities. Written notification from Student Disability Services is required. If you are eligible to receive an accommodation and would like to request it for this course, please contact Student Disability Services. Allow one week advance notice to ensure enough time for reasonable accommodations to be made. Otherwise, it is not guaranteed that the accommodation can be provided on a timely basis. Accommodations are not retroactive. Students who have questions about Student Disability Services or who have, or think they may have, a disability (psychiatric, attentional, learning, vision, hearing, physical, medical, etc.) are invited to contact Student Disability Services for a confidential discussion in Union Building Suite 200 or by phone at 658-6267.

## Religious Holy Days

DePauw University embraces the religious diversity of its students, faculty, and staff. Accordingly, faculty members are expected to excuse students from class and be flexible with respect to deadlines for required coursework in order to enable students to observe religious holy days. Faculty are also expected to make it possible for students observing holy days to make up any work they miss, provided arrangements are made in advance. Students are expected to notify their instructors of their intent to observe holy days at least one week in advance of these days. For this class I ask that you notify me by e-mail at least 7 days in advance of the date in question with the time you will be missing class and the reason for this missed class.
