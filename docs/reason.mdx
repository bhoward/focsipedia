# ReasonML

[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) (often just called Reason) is a functional
programming language developed at Facebook by Jordan Walke, who also created the
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework. It belongs to the
[ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)) family of statically-typed
functional languages, which includes [Standard ML](http://sml-family.org/),
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and Microsoft's [F#](https://fsharp.org/). ML was originally
developed as the **M**eta **L**anguage for the LCF theorem prover at the University of
Edinburgh, and has long been a valuable tool for programmers working with formal logic or
developing other programming languages. It was a major influence in the design of the
functional languages [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), and more recently it has seen adoption in financial
services (for example, [Bloomberg](https://bloomberg.com/) and
[Jane Street](https://janestreet.com)) and web development (particularly at
[Facebook](https://facebook.com)).

Reason is a dialect of OCaml with a syntax that is more comfortable for programmers
familiar with JavaScript or other languages in the C/C++/Java family. One advantage of
building on OCaml is that its compiler is remarkably fast and sophisticated, and it can
generate JavaScript output for running programs in a web browser. In fact, since the
compiler itself is written in OCaml, it is possible to compile the entire system to
JavaScript and run it in the browser.

Here is an editor where you can type in ReasonML code and execute it (click the button
or type Ctrl-Enter):

```reason edit
let x = 6;
let y = x * 7;
let rec fact = (x) =>
  if (x <= 1) {
    1
  } else {
    x * fact(x - 1)
  };
fact(5);
```

If for some reason you want to reset the interpreter before executing the code (so that
it will forget previous bindings), press the Shift key plus Ctrl-Enter.

There are several other places online where you can run ReasonML code, although they
will not always match the setup here (particularly the available libraries):

* The main Reason site, https://reasonml.github.io/en/, has an online environment where
you can [Try](https://reasonml.github.io/en/try) it and see the corresponding OCaml and
JavaScript code.

* There is a notebook-like REPL at https://sketch.sh/.

* [repl.it](https://repl.it/) now supports ReasonML as one of its languages.

You can also [install Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/installation) on your
own computer and run it locally (or develop your own web site with React!). If you do this,
I recommend using the free [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor
along with a plugin for Reason; this will give the complete IDE experience.
