## Hello from Docusaurus
Are you ready to create the documentation site for your open source project?
### Headers
will show up on the table of contents on the upper right
So that your users will know what this page is all about without scrolling down or even without reading too much.
### Only h2 and h3 will be in the toc
The headers are well-spaced so that the hierarchy is clear.
- lists will help you
- present the key points
- that you want your users to remember
  - and you may nest them
    - multiple times

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_! Also math: $\frac{355}{113}\approx\pi$

Here is some code:

```reason
let y = 42 /* this is not evaluated */
let z = "hello"
let w = [1, 2, 3]
```

```ocaml hidden
let x = 6;;
```

```reason edit
let y = x * 7
```

The next one should be "reason hidden" when it is debugged.

```reason hidden
Graphics_js.fill_circle(40, 40, 10)
```

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$
