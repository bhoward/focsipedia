One of the hallmarks of modern functional programming is a strong and rich
systems of types. The type of an expression can be thought of as the set of all
values that the expression might have; by specifying the type of a parameter to
a function, it constrains the values that may be provided as input. In this
sense, the type of a function is then a form of contract: if the input satisfies
some condition (is a value in the parameter type), then the output is also
guaranteed to satisfy a condition (be a value of the result type).
