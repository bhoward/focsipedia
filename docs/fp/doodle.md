## Introduction
We will be using the [Doodle](https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/) graphics library, which accompanies the
book [Creative Scala](https://www.creativescala.org/creative-scala/) by Dave Gurnell and Noel Welsh.

One way to work with the library is to make your own fork of the GitHub repository
https://github.com/bhoward/creative-scala-template.
You can either clone it to your local machine and run the SBT console there, or create a GitHub codespace and
run it on the web.
Instructions for both approaches are in the README file within the repository.

The remainder of this page is a reference to the Doodle library, plus some examples.
Substantial parts of this were co-written by [Sang Truong](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sttruong/) (DePauw 2021).

## Basic Types

When working with graphics, we will need some basic types beyond `Int`, `Double`, and `String`.
Although we could use `Double` to describe **angles**, it will be helpful to have a separate `Angle` type, which
may be thought of as a `Double` together with a "unit" (_e.g._, degrees or radians).
The Doodle library defines methods `degrees`, `radians`, and `spins` as extensions on the `Double` type, so
that the values `360.degrees`, `2 * math.Pi.radians`, and `1.turns` all represent one complete turn around a circle.

**Points** in two dimensions can be specified by two coordinates, `x` and `y`, where we adopt the convention that
`x` increases from left to right, while `y` increases from bottom to top
(the location of the origin will be discussed later).
Again, these could just be given by two `Double` values, but Doodle introduces a `Point` type with two constructors:
* `Point(x, y)` creates a Cartesian point from `Double` values `x` and `y`, while
* `Point(r, theta)` creates a point in polar coordinates, where `r` is a `Double` giving the distance from the origin,
and `theta` is an `Angle` giving the counter-clockwise angle from the `x`-axis.

For example, `Point(100, 0.degrees)` is the same as `Point(100, 0)`, while `Point(100, math.Pi.radians / 2)` and
`Point(100, 0.25.turns)` are both the same as `Point(0, 100)`.

## The `Image` type
The fundamental type of a drawing in Doodle is `Image`.[^1]
Some built-in functions used to construct geometric shapes are `circle`, `rectangle`, `triangle`, `regularPolygon`, `star`, and `rightArrow`.
There are also some special cases and variations: `square`, `roundedRectangle`, `equilateralTriangle`, `arc`, `pie`, and `line`.
The size arguments for all of these functions are of type `Double`, plus the `regularPolygon` and `star` functions also take the number of vertices as an `Int`.
The `arc` and `pie` functions also take an argument of type `Angle`, as discussed above.
Every image in Doodle has a **bounding box**, which is a minimal rectangle that can cover the image.
The center of the bounding box by default is at (0, 0), the **origin** for that image (exceptions include
the equilateral triangle, whose origin is the center of the triangle, and the arc and pie shapes, whose origin is
the center of the circle).
The built-in triangle function creates an isoceles triangle with the base on the bottom edge of the bounding box and the vertex in the middle of the top edge.
Details about the built-in functions to create geometric shapes in Doodle are in the following table:

| Function | Argument(s) | Bounding box size |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `Image.rectangle(w, h)`  | Width (w) and Height (h) | $w\times h$ |
| `Image.triangle(w, h)`| Base (w) and Height (h)| $w\times h$ |
| `Image.circle(d)` | Diameter (d)  | $d\times d$ |
| `Image.regularPolygon(n, r)`| Number of sides (n), Distance from center to vertex (r) | $2r\times 2r$ (roughly) |
| `Image.star(n, r1, r2)` | Number of sides (n), Outer radius (r1), Inner radius (r2) | $2r_1\times 2r_1$ (roughly) |
| `Image.rightArrow(w, h)` | Width (w) and Height (h) | $w\times h$ |
| `Image.square(w)`  | Side length (w)  | $w\times w$ |
| `Image.roundedRectangle(w, h, r)` | Width (w), Height (h), and Corner radius (r) | $w\times h$ |
| `Image.equilateralTriangle(w)` | Side length (w) | $w\times h\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |
| `Image.arc(d, theta)` | Diameter (d) and Angle extent (theta) | varies |
| `Image.pie(d, theta)` | Diameter (d) and Angle extent (theta) | varies |
| `Image.line(x, y)` | Horizontal (x) and Vertical (y) | $x\times y$ |

[^1]: The Doodle library also has a type called `Picture` which parallels many of the features of `Image`, but which
has some more advanced capabilities.
We will not be discussing this further; see the
[Doodle documentation](https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/) for details.

Method `.draw()` is used to display the `Image`:
```scala
val row1 = Image.rectangle(100, 50) `beside`
  Image.triangle(50, 100) `beside`
  Image.circle(100) `beside`
  Image.regularPolygon(6, 50) `beside`
  Image.star(7, 50, 20) `beside`
  Image.rightArrow(100, 50)
val row2 = Image.square(100) `beside`
  Image.roundedRectangle(100, 50, 10) `beside`
  Image.equilateralTriangle(100) `beside`
  Image.arc(100, 60.degrees) `beside`
  Image.pie(100, 60.degrees) `beside`
  Image.line(100, 50)
val image = row1 `above` row2
image.draw()
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
val row1 = Image.rectangle(100, 50) `beside`
  Image.triangle(50, 100) `beside`
  Image.circle(100) `beside`
  Image.regularPolygon(6, 50) `beside`
  Image.star(7, 50, 20) `beside`
  Image.rightArrow(100, 50)
val row2 = Image.square(100) `beside`
  Image.roundedRectangle(100, 50, 10) `beside`
  Image.equilateralTriangle(100) `beside`
  Image.arc(100, 60.degrees) `beside`
  Image.pie(100, 60.degrees) `beside`
  Image.line(100, 50)
val image = row1 `above` row2
RenderFile(image, "shapes.png")
```

The value `Image.empty` is used to create an empty image with a zero-size bounding box;
it is often useful as a default image when there is nothing to draw, and it is an identity element for the image combination operations described below.

### Text

Another kind of primitive image is text.
By default, `Image.text(s)` gives you the string `s` rendered in a plain 12-point sans-serif font.
You can change the font with the `font` method, which takes an object of type `Font`.
There are two predefined `Font` values: `Font.defaultSansSerif` and `Font.defaultSerif`.
They may be modified with methods `bold`, `italic`, and `size(p)`, where `p` is an integer point size.

You can also create a `Font` object by specifying four values: `FontFamily`, `FontStyle`, `FontWeight`, and `FontSize`.
In addition to `FontFamily.serif` and `FontFamily.sansSerif`, there are `FontFamily.monospaced` and `FontFamily.named(s)`,
where `s` is a string giving the name of a font on the machine where Scala is running; this will typically include such
standards as `"Helvetica"` and `"Times"`, but this is not guaranteed.
The `FontStyle` can be `FontStyle.normal` or `FontStyle.italic`; the `FontWeight` can be `FontWeight.normal` or `FontWeight.bold`.
For the `FontSize`, you specify the point size `p` with the value `FontSize.points(p)`.
Putting this all together, you might choose a 24-point monospaced italic font with
`Font(FontFamily.monospaced, FontStyle.italic, FontWeight.normal, FontSize.points(24))`.

```scala mdoc:silent
val textImage =
  Image.text("Hello World!").font(Font.defaultSerif.size(36).bold) `above`
  Image.text("Lorem ipsum").font(
    Font(FontFamily.monospaced, FontStyle.italic, FontWeight.normal, FontSize.points(24)))
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(textImage, "text.png")
```

### Paths

We can make more general shapes out of sequences of instructions of the following forms:
* Move to a given point;
* Draw a line from the current point to a given point;
* Draw a curve (with certain properties) from the current point to a given point.

We refer to such a sequence as a **path**.
A path may be either **open** or **closed**; a closed path will include a line from the ending point back to the beginning if one is not specified.
We create a path in Doodle with the function `Image.path(p)`, where `p` is a value describing the sequence of instructions.

One way to construct such a value is to start with either `OpenPath.empty` or `ClosedPath.empty`, and then apply a chain of methods:
* `moveTo(point)`, `moveTo(x, y)`, or `moveTo(r, theta)`: move to the given point (details below);
* `lineTo(point)`, `lineTo(x, y)`, or `lineTo(r, theta)`: draw a line to the given point;
* `curveTo(cp1, cp2, point)`, `curveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, px, py)`, or `curveTo(r1, t1, r2, t2, r, theta)`: draw a [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) to the given point; 
`cp1` is the first **control point**, which determines the starting direction of the curve from the initial point, while `cp2` is the second control point,
which determines the direction heading into the destination, `point`.

As a convenience, each of these methods allows the points to be specified as a `Point` object
or as separate Cartesian coordinates `x` and `y`, or as polar coordinates `r` and `theta`.

For some purposes, it is more convenient to construct a path value from a list of `PathElement` objects.
For example, instead of
```scala
OpenPath.empty.moveTo(100, 0).lineTo(100, 45.degrees)
```
you can do the following:
```scala
val elements = List(PathElement.moveTo(100, 0), PathElement.lineTo(100, 45.degrees))
OpenPath(elements)
```
The advantage of this form is that all of our usual operations on lists are available
to work with the sequence of instructions before turning them into a path.

Here is an example to help you visualize the BÃ©zier control points.
Note how the distance to the control point affects how quickly the curve diverges from that direction:
```scala mdoc:silent
def cpDiagram(p1: Point, p2: Point, cp1: Point, cp2: Point): Image = {
  val curve = Image.path(OpenPath.empty
    .moveTo(p1).curveTo(cp1, cp2, p2))
  val boundary = Image.path(OpenPath.empty
    .moveTo(p1).lineTo(cp1)
    .moveTo(cp2).lineTo(p2)).strokeDash(List(4, 4))
  val labels = Image.text("p1").originAt(Landmark.bottomCenter).at(p1) `on`
    Image.text("p2").originAt(Landmark.bottomCenter).at(p2) `on`
    Image.text("cp1").originAt(Landmark.topCenter).at(cp1) `on`
    Image.text("cp2").originAt(Landmark.topCenter).at(cp2)
  curve `on` boundary `on` labels
}
val bezierImage1 = cpDiagram(Point(-60, 0), Point(60, 0), Point(0, -60), Point(60, -30))
val bezierImage2 = cpDiagram(Point(-60, 0), Point(60, 0), Point(0, -60), Point(60, -90))
val bezierImage = bezierImage1 `beside` Image.empty.size(20, 0) `beside` bezierImage2
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(bezierImage, "bezier.png")
```

Here is an example of using a closed path to draw an AND gate, on top of input and output wires drawn with `openPath`:
```scala mdoc:silent
val andGate = Image.path(ClosedPath.empty
  .moveTo(-15, -30)
  .lineTo(0, -30)
  .curveTo(Point(15, -30), Point(30, -15), Point(30, 0))
  .curveTo(Point(30, 15), Point(15, 30), Point(0, 30))
  .lineTo(-15, 30))
val andWires = Image.path(OpenPath.empty
  .moveTo(-15, -15).lineTo(-45, -15)
  .moveTo(-15, 15).lineTo(-45, 15)
  .moveTo(30, 0).lineTo(60, 0))
val andImage = andGate `on` andWires
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(andImage, "andGate.png")
```

The origin for a path is the starting point $(0, 0)$, and the bounding box is just large enough to contain all
of the points of the path.

A final way to construct a path image is to fit a **spline** curve to a list of points:
```scala mdoc:silent
val points = for (x <- 0 to 360) yield Point(x, x.degrees.sin * 100)
val sineImage = Image.interpolatingSpline(points)
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(sineImage, "sineWave.png")
```

## Position and Manipulation

Of course, the real interest of a graphics library is not just in the basic shapes, but
in how to combine them into larger images.
Since an `Image` is a type of value that we can construct and manipulate, we may use the full
machinery of the Scala language to develop functions that build complex images **compositionally**,
allowing us to use the substitution model to understand what the finished `Image` will be in terms
of its component parts.

Two images may be combined with three primary operations:
* Overlaying: `image1.on(image2)` lines up the origin of `image1` over the origin of `image2`;
* Horizontal joining: `image1.beside(image2)` lines up the right edge of the bounding box of `image1`
with the left edge of that of `image2`; and
* Vertical joining: `image1.above(image2)` lines up the bottom edge of the bounding box of `image1`
with the top edge of that of `image2`.

For `image1.beside(image2)`, the images are shifted up or down so that their origins are on a horizontal line,
while for `image1.above(image2)` the origins will line up vertically.
In all cases, a new bounding box will be computed that contains both images, and its origin will be in the center.

As a convenience, Scala permits a method call such as `a.on(b)` to be written in **operator form**
as ``a `on` b``; we will generally use this form.
Doodle also provides two additional methods, `under` and `below`, which are just `on` and `above` with the arguments
swapped: ``a `under` b`` is the same as ``b `on` a``, and ``a `below` b`` is the same as ``b `above` a``.

### Bounding Box and Origin

To help visualize the role of origin and bounding box, the `Image` type provides the method `debug`,
which draws a visible bounding box and puts a small circle on the origin.
Here is an example of putting a circle beside an equilateral triangle, with `debug` used to show the
individual shapes and then the result:
```scala mdoc:silent
val circle = Image.circle(100)
val triangle = Image.equilateralTriangle(100)
val result = circle `beside` triangle
val space = Image.empty.size(20, 20)
val inputs = circle.debug `above` space `above` triangle.debug
val debugDemo = inputs `beside` space `beside` result.debug
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(debugDemo, "debugDemo.png")
```

We may modify the bounding box with the methods `size` and `margin`:
* `image.size(width, height)` replaces the current box with one having the given dimensions, centered on the origin;
* `image.margin(top, right, bottom, left)` expands the bounding box by the given amounts in each direction
(a negative amount will shrink the box on that side);
* `image.margin(w, h)` is equivalent to `image.margin(h, w, h, w)`, so it expands by `w` both left and right, and
by `h` both top and bottom; and
* `image.margin(s)` is equivalent to `image.margin(s, s, s, s)`, adding an extra space `s` on all sides.

In the example above, we used `Image.empty.size(20, 20)` to create an empty image of size 20 by 20, to use as a spacer.
We would have gotten the same result with `Image.empty.margin(10)`.

To change the position of the origin, use the `originAt` method.
Its argument specifies the new position relative to the current coordinate system of the image.
As with the `PathElement` methods, the position may be specified as a `Point`, two `Double` (Cartesian) coordinates,
or a `Double` and an `Angle` (polar form).
If the origin is moved to a point outside the bounding box, Doodle will calculate a new bounding box just large
enough to contain the old one plus the origin point; the origin will always be within the bounding box.

The position of the new origin may also be specified as a `Landmark`:
* `Landmark.topLeft`, `Landmark.topRight`, `Landmark.bottomLeft`, and `Landmark.bottomRight` are the four corners
of the bounding box
* `Landmark.origin` is the current origin point, and `Landmark.point(x, y)` is the same as `Point(x, y)`
* `Landmark.centerLeft` and `Landmark.centerRight` are on the horizontal line through the origin, at either the
left or the right edge of the bounding box (note that, despite the name, these points are not necessarily in the
middle of those edges; they will be at the same $y$ coordinate as the origin)
* `Landmark.topCenter` and `Landmark.bottomCenter` are similarly on the vertical line through the origin, at either
the top or bottom edge of the bounding box
* More generally, `Landmark.percent(px, py)` will be located at the given percentage of the way from the origin to
the respective sides. For example, `Landmark.percent(50, -100)` will be a point halfway between the origin and the right edge, located along the bottom edge of the bounding box.

Here is a demonstration of using landmarks to line up red, green, and blue triangles at their corners,
on top of the point halfway between the center and the bottom edge of a yellow triangle:
```scala mdoc:silent
val redTriangle = Image.equilateralTriangle(100).fillColor(Color.red)
val greenTriangle = Image.equilateralTriangle(100).fillColor(Color.green)
val blueTriangle = Image.equilateralTriangle(100).fillColor(Color.blue)
val yellowTriangle = Image.equilateralTriangle(100).fillColor(Color.yellow)
val landmarkDemo = redTriangle.originAt(Landmark.topCenter) `on`
  greenTriangle.originAt(Landmark.bottomLeft) `on`
  blueTriangle.originAt(Landmark.bottomRight) `on`
  yellowTriangle.originAt(Landmark.percent(0, -50))
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(landmarkDemo, "landmarkDemo.png")
```

### Transformation

We can scale, rotate, and translate images:
* `image.rotate(angle)` rotates counter-clockwise around the origin by the given `Angle`
* `image.scale(sx, sy)` scales the image by a factor of `sx` horizontally and `sy` vertically
* `image.at(point)`, `image.at(x, y)`, `image.at(r, theta)`, and `image.at(landmark)` shift the image
by the given amount relative to the origin; in fact, these are just the opposite of the `originAt` methods
(`image.at(x, y)` is the same as `image.originAt(-x, -y)`, _etc._)
* `image.transform(xform)` applies a general `Transform` object (see below).

As we have seen, in a compositional style it is nice to have types of values that we can manipulate to
describe the various operations.
A `Transform` object represents an arbitrary two-dimensional **affine transformation**.
One way to define such a transformation is to specify a $3\times 3$ matrix, where the bottom row is 0, 0, 1:
$$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  s_x & r_x & t_x\\
  r_y & s_y & t_y\\
  0   & 0   & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
$$
Given a point $(x, y)$, the effect of the transformation may be calculated by multiplying the matrix by the
vector $\langle x, y, 1\rangle$:
$$
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x'\\
    y'\\
    1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  s_x & r_x & t_x\\
  r_y & s_y & t_y\\
  0   & 0   & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x\\
    y\\
    1
  \end{bmatrix}
$$
This is equivalent to the following computations:
$$
  \begin{matrix}
  x' = s_x x + r_x y + t_x\\
  y' = r_y x + s_y y + t_y
  \end{matrix}
$$
The coefficients $s_x$ and $s_y$ are referred to as the **scale** factors, $r_x$ and $r_y$ are the **shear**
factors, and $t_x$ and $t_y$ are the **translate** factors.
The `Transform` object provides various methods to construct and manipulate these values:
* `Transform.identity` gives the identity matrix:
   $ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $
* `Transform.scale(sx, sy)` gives $ \begin{bmatrix} sx & 0 & 0\\ 0 & sy & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $
* `Transform.translate(tx, ty)` gives $ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & tx\\ 0 & 1 & ty\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $
* `Transform.rotate(a)` gives $ \begin{bmatrix} \cos a & -\sin a & 0\\ \sin a & \cos a & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $
* `Transform(Array(sx, rx, tx, ry, sy, ty, 0, 0, 1))` creates an arbitrary `Transform` with the given coefficients
* `xform1.andThen(xform2)` combines the given transforms (by taking the matrix product `xform2` times `xform1`)

Although Doodle does not directly define a shearing transformation, you can construct one from an array.
For example, a horizontal shear by a factor of 0.5 is given by
`Transform(Array(1, 0.5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1))`.
Here is a demonstration of some transforms applied to a triangle:
```scala mdoc:silent
val tri = Image.triangle(100, 50)
val tri2 = tri.strokeColor(Color.lightGray)
val scaleXform = Transform.scale(0.5, -1)
val translateXform = Transform.translate(25, 25)
val rotateXform = Transform.rotate(30.degrees)
val shearXform = Transform(Array(1, 0.5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1))
val combo1Xform = scaleXform.andThen(translateXform)
val combo2Xform = translateXform.andThen(scaleXform)
val transformDemo = tri.transform(scaleXform).on(tri2) `beside`
  tri.transform(translateXform).on(tri2) `beside`
  tri.transform(rotateXform).on(tri2) `beside`
  tri.transform(shearXform).on(tri2) `beside`
  tri.transform(combo1Xform).on(tri2) `beside`
  tri.transform(combo2Xform).on(tri2)
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(transformDemo, "transformDemo.png")
```

## Styles

Various details of the drawing of an `Image` may be customized, falling into two broad categories of
**stroking** and **filling**.
The stroke style is used when drawing paths and the outlines of shapes,
while the fill style is used for the interiors of closed paths and shapes.
The default stroke is a one-unit wide black line, and the default fill is unfilled.

The methods to change the stroke style include:
* `image.strokeColor(c)`, where `c` is a `Color` (see below)
* `image.strokeWidth(w)`, where `w` is a `Double`
* `image.strokeCap(cap)`, where `cap` is `Cap.butt`, `Cap.round`, or `Cap.square`&mdash;this determines
whether a "decoration" is added to the end of lines, either to round them off or add a squared-off extension; the
default is `Cap.butt`, which is undecorated
* `image.strokeJoin(join)`, where `join` is `Join.bevel`, `Join.miter`, or `Join.round`&mdash;this determines
what happens when lines meet in successive segments of a path; the default is `Join.miter`, which extends the
outer edges of the strokes until the meet; `Join.round` will draw a rounded connection, while `Join.bevel` cuts
the join off with a short line segment
* `image.strokeDash(pattern)`, where `pattern` is a `List[Double]` giving the lengths of alternating dashes and
spaces for a dashed line
* `image.noStroke` leaves the image unstroked

```scala mdoc:silent
val wedge = Image.path(OpenPath.empty.lineTo(50, 100).curveTo(50, 0, 75, 0, 100, 0))
val demoA = wedge.strokeWidth(8)
val demoB = wedge.strokeWidth(8).strokeCap(Cap.round).strokeJoin(Join.round)
val demoC = wedge.strokeWidth(8).strokeCap(Cap.square).strokeJoin(Join.bevel)
val demoD = wedge.strokeWidth(2).strokeDash(List(5, 2, 1, 2))
val strokeDemo = demoA.debug `beside`
  space `beside` demoB.debug `beside`
  space `beside` demoC.debug `beside`
  space `beside` demoD.debug
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(strokeDemo, "strokeDemo")
```

The methods to change the fill style include:
* `image.fillColor(c)`, where `c` is a `Color`
* `image.fillGradient(g)`, where `g` is a `Gradient` (see below)
* `image.noFill` leaves the image unfilled

### Colors

It is surprisingly complicated to specify colors in full generality.
The model used by Doodle is the common
[24-bit RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monochrome_and_RGB_color_formats#24-bit_RGB) palette,
where three 8-bit bytes are used to determine the corresponding levels of red, green, and blue.
One byte permits values from 0 to 255, so one way to select a color in Doodle is with the method
`Color.rgb(r, g, b)`, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are each `Int` values in that range.

Choosing multiple colors that work well together can be difficult with raw RGB components, so Doodle also
supports the [hue-saturation-lightness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) (HSL) model:
the **hue** is an `Angle` in a color wheel, with red at $0\degree$, green at $120\degree$, and blue at $240\degree$.
The **saturation** is a `Double` between 0.0 and 1.0 that measures how strong the color is; a saturation of 0.0
will just be a shade of gray.
The **lightness** is also a `Double` between 0.0 and 1.0; fully saturated "pure" colors will have a lightness of
0.5; lower values of lightness will tend towards black, while higher values will tend towards white.
The Doodle method `Color.hsl(h, s, l)` will build the corresponding color.

For example, here are two ways to use `hsl` to construct 4-color palettes,
one with pure colors and the other monochrome:
```scala mdoc:silent
def showPalette(c0: Color, c1: Color, c2: Color, c3: Color): Image = {
  val sq = Image.square(100).noStroke
  sq.fillColor(c0) `beside`
    sq.fillColor(c1) `beside`
    sq.fillColor(c2) `beside`
    sq.fillColor(c3)
}
val palette1 = showPalette(
  Color.hsl(0.turns, 1, 0.5),
  Color.hsl(0.25.turns, 1, 0.5),
  Color.hsl(0.5.turns, 1, 0.5),
  Color.hsl(0.75.turns, 1, 0.5)
)
val palette2 = showPalette(
  Color.hsl(0.turns, 0, 0),
  Color.hsl(0.turns, 0, 0.25),
  Color.hsl(0.turns, 0, 0.5),
  Color.hsl(0.turns, 0, 0.75)
)
val paletteDemo = palette1 `above` palette2
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(paletteDemo, "paletteDemo.png")
```

In addition to the red, green, and blue components, each color value carries a fourth component, a `Double` value
in the range 0 to 1 known as **alpha**.
Such values may be constructed with the methods `Color.rgba(r, g, b, a)` and `Color.hsla(r, g, b, a)`, where the
fourth argument, `a`, is the alpha value.
The alpha value determines how transparent a color is when it is drawn on top of something else.
If alpha is 1.0 (the default if not specified), then the color is completely opaque&mdash;nothing
shows through from below.
If alpha is 0.0, then the color is completely transparent&mdash;the underlying image is unchanged.
For values of alpha in between, the alphas of the top and underlying layers are used to proportionally blend
the colors according to the OVER [compositing rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing).
Here is an example:
```scala mdoc:silent
val front = Image.circle(100)
val back = Image.square(100).fillColor(Color.red)
val alphaDemo = back `under`
  front.fillColor(Color.rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.25)).at(-50, 50) `under`
  front.fillColor(Color.rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)).at(50, 50) `under`
  front.fillColor(Color.rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.75)).at(-50, -50) `under`
  front.fillColor(Color.rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)).at(50, -50)
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(alphaDemo, "alphaDemo.png")
```

Instead of choosing a color based on its components, Doodle also provides a large number of named `Color`
constants such as `Color.blue`, `Color.cyan`, and `Color.lightGoldenrodYellow`.
The list is based on the [CSS named colors](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#named-colors), although
camelCase capitalization has been added to match Java and Scala identifier conventions.

Given a `Color`, there are a variety of methods available to inspect its components and create related colors.
Here are a few of the most useful:
* `c.spin(angle)` creates a new `Color` with hue rotated by the given `Angle`
* `c.saturateBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with saturation multiplied by `1 + fraction`; the type of
`fraction` is a `Normalized` number, which is like a `Double` but restricted to the range 0 to 1; to
specify a fraction of 50%, use `0.5.normalized`; the resulting saturation will likewise be clamped within 0 to 1
* `c.desaturateBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with saturation multiplied by `1 - fraction`
* `c.lightenBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with lightness multiplied by `1 + fraction`
* `c.darkenBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with lightness multiplied by `1 - fraction`
* `c.fadeInBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with alpha multiplied by `1 + fraction`
* `c.fadeOutBy(fraction)` creates a new `Color` with alpha multiplied by `1 - fraction`

### Gradients

Fill style can be specified as a **gradient** instead of a single `Color`.
A gradient interpolates between two or more colors; it may be **linear**, where the colors change smoothly
between parallel lines, or it may be **radial**, where the colors change smoothly between nested circles.

The Doodle library provides three convenience methods for constructing common cases `Gradient` objects,
plus two more general methods to handle arbitrary cases:
* `Gradient.dichromaticVertical(c1, c2, d)` takes two `Color` values, `c1` and `c2`, plus a `Double` distance `d`,
and yields a `Gradient` that changes from `c1` on the line $y=0$ to the color `c2` on the line $y=d$; outside that
range, the gradient repeats in a cycle
* `Gradient.dichromaticHorizontal(c1, c2, d)` is similar, except `c1` is on the line $x=0$ and `c2` is on the line $x=d$
* `Gradient.dichromaticRadial(c1, c2, r)` yields a radial `Gradient` where `c1` is the color at the origin and
`c2` is the color on the circle at distance `r` from the origin; outside that circle, the cycle repeats
* `Gradient.linear(p1, p2, stops, cycle)` interpolates along the line passing through the `Point` values `p1` and `p2`;
the argument `stops` is a `List[(Color, Double)]` that specifies the colors at two or more key points (given as fractions
between 0 and 1) along the way; `cycle` may be `Gradient.CycleMethod.noCycle`, `Gradient.CycleMethod.reflect`, or
`Gradient.CycleMethod.repeat`
* `Gradient.radial(p1, p2, r, stops, cycle)` creates a radial gradient with center `p1`, radius `r`, and arguments
`stops` and `cycle` as above; it also takes a "focus" point `p2`, which specifies the point inside the circle where
the gradient starts (note that this does not have to be the same as the center)

```scala mdoc:silent
val g1 = Gradient.dichromaticHorizontal(Color.red, Color.blue, 50)
val g2 = Gradient.dichromaticRadial(Color.red, Color.blue, 50)
val g3 = Gradient.linear(Point(-25, -25), Point(25, 25),
  List((Color.red, 0.2), (Color.blue, 0.8)), Gradient.CycleMethod.reflect)
val g4 = Gradient.radial(Point(0, 0), Point(25, 0), 50,
  List((Color.red, 0.2), (Color.blue, 0.8)), Gradient.CycleMethod.noCycle)
val gradientDemo = Image.square(100).fillGradient(g1) `beside` space `beside`
  Image.square(100).fillGradient(g2) `beside` space `beside`
  Image.square(100).fillGradient(g3) `beside` space `beside`
  Image.square(100).fillGradient(g4)
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(gradientDemo, "gradientDemo.png")
```

## Some Demonstrations
Here is an arrow using `OpenPath`, and a function to display a clock face for a given time:
```scala mdoc:silent
def arrow(len: Double): Image = {
  Image.path(
    OpenPath.empty
      .lineTo(0, len)
      .lineTo(10, len - 10)
      .moveTo(0, len)
      .lineTo(-10, len - 10)
  ).strokeCap(Cap.round).strokeJoin(Join.round).strokeWidth(3)
}

def clock(time: Double): Image = {
  val hourHand = arrow(80).rotate(-(time / 12).turns)
  val minuteHand = arrow(100).rotate(-time.turns)
  val face = Image.circle(220).fillColor(Color.white)
  hourHand `on` minuteHand `on` face
}

val arrowDemo = arrow(100).debug `beside`
  space `beside` clock(4.75) `beside`
  space `beside` clock(12.0)
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(arrowDemo, "arrowDemo.png")
```

Using the arrow, here is a function to visualize a linked list:
```scala mdoc:silent
def listNode(n: Int): Image = {
  val f = Font.defaultSansSerif.size(24)
  val field = Image.square(50).fillColor(Color.white).strokeWidth(2)
  val valueField = Image.text(n.toString).font(f) `on` field
  val nextField = arrow(50).rotate(-90.degrees) `on` field
  valueField `beside` nextField
}

def showList(nums: List[Int]): Image = {
  nums match
    case Nil => Image.circle(10).fillColor(Color.black)
    case head :: tail => listNode(head) `beside` showList(tail)
}

val listDemo = showList(List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
```
```scala mdoc:passthrough
RenderFile(listDemo, "listDemo.png")
```
