This is a site for building a hyper-linked reference/textbook for the Foundations of
Computation course at DePauw University. Pages may be written in Markdown, with embedded
math using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and executable code blocks in either [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) or [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

The site is constructed using [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/).

Reason/OCaml playground code (still under development):

* `refmt.js` is the Reason-OCaml transpiler, as installed by `npm install reason`.

* `toplevel.js` is the Js_of_OCaml toplevel used by https://sketch.sh/ (see https://github.com/Sketch-sh/sketch-sh and https://github.com/Sketch-sh/engine).
