Read about [Computability](/docs/lang/computability) and the [Halting Problem](/docs/lang/halting). This is advanced material that will not be tested in this class, but it is worth seeing as the culmination of the language and computation models we have been exploring.

If you are interested, there is also related material on the [Lambda Calculus](/docs/fp/lambda), which relates Turing Machines back to functional programming.
