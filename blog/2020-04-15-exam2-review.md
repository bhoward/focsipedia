There are some exam review materials on Moodle (a practice exam and solutions, and a topic list). The Wednesday class session will be a time to go over any questions you have.

Watch the review session from [Section A](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hyRl3n4X-UImwmZ4z1c_cOpQ0AUGLKOR/view) (with [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-wDAQUNFtorMa9LTVvDKp_SipR4qYAfJ)) and [Section B](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v9d9-b5KxOp654gXZ9HmCQO_NH82ilVn/view) (with [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-xtuFt2nOK1U18vWj6YL3My9zjYN2qCH)).

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgGnYi1asNWEM3JGr1NyGoFGsdiuJl1l/view) (and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-yv_cf65gTPJCQloN8gj57FgK6q_DCv4)) where I go over the answers to the short Google Forms-based practice exam.
