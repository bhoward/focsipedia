Read about <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/lang/fsa')}>finite-state automata</a>, and try the exercises in that section.

Watch this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQM-pgBE6BQtjOWTpUycLHTflvIopSMy/view) (and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-mvty5DQoMbo7I6MbvfgCuuJa1WhIu_-)) of my toy telephone. Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kI7JeF6LzXlE02I37uekmQhYi4XFvzv4/view) of the telephone itself, which was mistakenly not captured when I recorded the session.

Here is the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XGh1fOvJDv5HbNDafolK1kRlrEmr_tDs/view) and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-p5DK4hJ08pUPITG9oYUc8YtQ8Docofi) from the section A class session.

(**Optional**) The paper by E.F. Moore I mention in the first video is:
