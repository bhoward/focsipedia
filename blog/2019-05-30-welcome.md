Blog features are powered by the blog plugin. Simple add files to the `blog` directory. It supports tags as well!

Delete the whole directory if you don't want the blog features. As simple as that!

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_! Also math: $\frac{355}{113}\approx\pi$

Here is some code:

```ocaml live hidden
let x = 6;;
```

```reason live
let y = x * 7
```

The next one should be "reason live hidden canvas" when it is debugged.

```reason live canvas
Graphics_js.fill_circle(40, 40, 10)
```

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$
