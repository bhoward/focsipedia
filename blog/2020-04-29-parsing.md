title: Parsing and Pushdown Automata
author: Brian Howard

Read about [parsing](/docs/lang/parsing) and [pushdown automata](/docs/lang/pda), and look at the exercises in those sections.

Here is the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EY-WPnyQYCwMDHBuxRXyqBqB2l7YU_cD/view) (and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=100AMiwpDtrUqs4S_acUgtHANLv5bP0q7)) from the section A class session. 

If you are interested in seeing actual parsing code, look at the section on [recursive descent and parser combinators](/docs/fp/parser-comb) (and if you are _really_ interested, take CSC 426, Compilers in the fall&hellip;).
