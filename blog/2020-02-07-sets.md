import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Skim the sections on set <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/sets/concepts')}>concepts</a> and <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/sets/algebra')}>algebra</a> (these two sections
should be mostly review of material you should have seen before, with emphasis
on the connection to propositional logic). Read the section on set <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/sets/programming')}>programming</a>.
Do <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/sets/programming#exercises')}>exercises 1, 4, 10, and 12</a> (to discuss in class).
