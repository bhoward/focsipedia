Skim the sections on set [concepts](/docs/sets/concepts) and [algebra](/docs/sets/algebra) (these two sections
should be mostly review of material you should have seen before, with emphasis
on the connection to propositional logic). Read the section on set [programming](/docs/sets/programming).
Do [exercises 1, 4, 10, and 12](/docs/sets/programming#exercises) (to discuss in class).
