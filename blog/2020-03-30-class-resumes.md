Classes will resume in an online format on Monday, March 30. Work on your <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/fp/doodle-project')}>DPoodle</a> drawings.

**Update** Also read about <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/ds/trees')}>trees</a> and watch the [corresponding video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8ITxdH2qX0i8Lse-rrnEap6X3vt-njA/view) (and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-cMXKmHRLjs_8v-1MfJ89qEFEJQEYBg6)).

Here are the videos and DyKnow slides from the in-class sessions:
* [Section A video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fZmQwPUAvxw4woQoaCSR08lGR2yrEHIm/view) and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-bWeUimbXYiWg4LyT87PTLU2Jrif9bqj)
* [Section B video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oBKn6LdDb1cDz2QqVz0MbR6QiXk8alED/view) and [DyKnow](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-fASjvsLaP0lO2r3dbjkMZc8yIsOiQXt)

My plan for now is ... <!--truncate--> 

* Lecture videos will be posted on this blog along with each day's reading. I hope to be able to do this a day or two in advance.
* Class sessions conducted over Google Meet will be for interaction and questions. If you are unable to join the session, it will be
recorded and a link will be posted here when the recording is available.
* Exams will still be held more-or-less as scheduled, although I am still working out the details.
* Instead of office hours, I will be happy to answer questions at any time by email or to set up an appointment for a phone call or video chat (Google Meet, Hangout, Skype, or something else that works for you).
